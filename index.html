        <p>Istanbul is an amazingly unique city! One of the many things that makes it so special is the fact that Istanbul is the only city on the planet that is placed in 2 continents; Europe, and Asia! Located at the near tip of the Asian side of Istanbul is Nakkaştepe! Nakkaştepe is a beautiful park that sits atop the hillside facing the Bosphorus Straits, and cascades naturally down the hill as a beautiful park.</p>

        <p>At the park theres' tons to see and do! During the summer months specifically, it's a popular place for wedding photos and photoshoots in general. You can zipline from the top of the park to the bottom after picking up some ice-cream from one of the many vendors around the park. You can also follow the directories posted all around the park and try out some of the cafes and sightseeing spots in the park to get a better view of the suspension bridge that sits just outside of the park's boundaries! You could easily spend a few hours here, and if you start the trek at the top of the park, then by the time you get to the bottom, you'll have had plenty to see and do, and be ready for the rest of the adventures and sights to see along the Straits!</p>

        </a>
        <p>With that, we have arrived at our second stop: The Blue  Mosque. The Blue Mosque was originally built in the early 17th century, and used to be very near the center of what is modern day Istanbul! It has some stunning architecural features that are sure to wow anyone who has the opportunity to see them for themsleves! A fun fact about this mosque is that it still functions as a religious site, but there is a space just for visitors to go through and have an opportunity to look around and explore. Just make sure your pants fall below your knees, or else you'll be turned away at the doors! To this day, it remains one of the largest mosques in Turkiye!</p>

        <p>There's tons to see and do around The Blue Mosque as well! Directly across from it sits the Hagia Sophia, another historic site that is definitely worth your time if you have the opportunity to stop by and explore. There's also a variety of different vendors and local shops and eateries all around the mosque. Located not too far away, resides the Grand Bazaar, where you can shop (and probably get lost) for hours or even days on end! All in all, there's tons to see and do after taking your time to behold the beauty of the Blue Mosque!</p>
